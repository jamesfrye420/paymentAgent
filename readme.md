## Problem Statement

Grab's payment systems must remain reliable and robust for both end users and partner services. Failures or inconsistencies can degrade customer experience, damage partner trust, and increase operational costs. This project provides a sandbox environment to simulate real‑world payment flows, detect faults proactively, and allow testers or automated agents to explore and diagnose issues without impacting live transactions.

Beyond fault detection, the sandbox serves as a training ground for AI and machine learning models aimed at payment failure prevention and self‑healing. By generating diverse failure scenarios, we can fine‑tune generative models to propose routing adjustments, retry logic, or other remedial actions automatically, and integrate root cause analysis to speed up troubleshooting.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Sandbox Simulation:** DeepSeek‑R1 (customized to generate varied gateway behaviors)
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Amazon Bedrock (Anthropic Opus‑4 model)
- **Self‑Healing Agent:** Fine‑tuned generative model (trained on sandbox data)

## Assumptions

1. Testers and bots will use this sandbox rather than live systems for fault detection.
2. Simulated data sufficiently approximates real payment gateway responses.
3. Failure scenarios generated by DeepSeek‑R1 cover the majority of common error codes and latencies.
4. AI models trained on sandbox data will generalize to production traffic patterns.


## Next Steps

1. **Queue Management:** Integrate a durable message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ or SQS) to handle high volumes of payment requests.
2. **Caching Layer:** Add Redis to cache results for identical transaction inputs, reducing redundant processing.
3. **Expanded Dataset:** Generate a larger, more diverse set of simulated transactions to further train and evaluate self‑healing models.
4. **Optimal Routing Model:** Develop and train a model to not only predict failures but also select the most cost‑effective and reliable provider path.
5. **Scalability Enhancements:** Containerize the sandbox and deploy with Kubernetes for horizontal scaling under load.
6. **Monitoring & Metrics:** Implement Prometheus/Grafana dashboards to track sandbox performance, model decisions, and failure rates over time.
